# Koko: The fun way to budget.
This project was created by a team of 7 students as part of the Accenture Tech Bootcamp Melbourne for 2026. The goal was to create a fun and engaging budgeting app that helps university students manage their finances effectively in this cost of living crisis.

It is a full-stack application built with a React/TypeScript-based frontend, Python backend and agentic AI integration via AWS Strands. The app allows users to enter in their grocery and petrol preferences, which are then used to generate a personalised shopping plan. This is all wrapped in a gamified interface that rewards users for sticking to their budget via a leaderboard, streaks and other fun features.

It also has first-class support for PWA technology, allowing the phone-centric university students of today to easily install the app on their phones and access it on the go, without needing the hassle of downloading from an app store.
